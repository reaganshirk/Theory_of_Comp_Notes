* Final will be cumulative 
* Midterm 2 Solutions
	* Problem 1
		* True
		* True
		* True
		* False
		* True
	* Problem 2
		* Derivation: Start with S and show each step
			* S -> LaR -> aAaR -> abaR -> abaDa -> ababa
			* S -> LaR -> AaaR -> baaR -> baaaD -> baaab
	* Problem 3
		* R1 -> aR1 | bR2
		  R2 -> aR2 | bR1 | lambda
	* Problem 4
		* Towards contradiction, assume B is a context free
		language, therefore the pumping lemma applies to it.
		B has pumping length p
		* Look at S = (0^p)(1^2p)(0^p), then |S| = 4p >= p and
		S is in B
			* S = uvxyz such that |vxy| <= p and |vy| > 0
			* pump up and S is no longer in B
	* Problem 5
		* DFA accepts binary strings of even length
		* Accepted: lambda, 0001, 1011, 0000, 0101, ...
		* Not accepted: 0, 1, 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, ...
		* S -> 00S | 01S | 10S | 11S | lambda
	* Problem 6
		* There are n+1 ways to split the string w into 2
		parts
		* Feed each part to the respective turing machines for
		A and B
			* If both MA and MB accept, accept
			* Otherwise try another split
		* If every split is rejected, reject
	* Problem 7
		* lambda goes to qreject following y -> y, L for all y
		in Gamma \ {0}
		* 10 goes to qreject following the path y -> y, L for
		all y in Gamma \ {0}
		* 0110 is rejected, I'll update notes later
		* 00011 is accepted, I'll update notes later
		* Accepts 0+1+
		* Upon acceptance, convert every 0 to a 1
		* Upon rejection:
			* If the string starts with a 1 or is lambda,
			then it is left unchanged
			* If the strings starts with a 0, then the first
			0 will be substituted with 0bar

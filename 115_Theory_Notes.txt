* Example Turing Machine Configuration
	* 10q101__ means that the turing machine
		* is in state q1
		* on the tape we have the string 1001
		*the head is located above the 0 which appears to the
		right of the state
* For execution
	* qo1001__
		* Say delta(qo, 1) = (o, q1, L) -->
		q10001__ __ __
	* <M> is some appropriate encoding for a turing machine M
* Homework 3
	* Problem 1 part 1:
		* accepting state qo goes to accepting state q1 with a
		1
		* accepting state q1 goes to q2 with a 1
		* q2 goes to q3 with a 1
		* qo goes to accepting state qaccept with a 0
		* q1 goes to accepting state qaccept with a 0
		* q2 goes to accepting state qaccept with a 0
		* q3 goes to accepting state qaccept with a 0, 1
		* qaccept self loops with 0, 1
	* Problem 1 part 2:
		* accepting state qo goes to q1 with a 0
		* q1 goes to q2 with a 1
		* q2 goes to accepting state qo with lambda, 0
		* q1 goes to q3 with a 0
	* Problem 2:
		* Towards contradiction, assume that L is regular with
		pumping length p
		* consider s = 0^p10^p
		* |s| >= p, |xy| <= p, y != lambda, s = xyz
		* pump up or down and obtain contradiction
	* Problem 3
		* Accepting state qo self loops with a 1 and goes to
		q1 with a 0
		* accepting state q1 self loop swith a 1 and goes to
		q2 with a 0
		* accepting state q2 self loops with a 1 and goes to
		q3 with a 0
		* q3 self loops on 0, 1
			S -> 0A|1S|lambda
			A -> 0B|1A|lambda
			B -> 0C|1B|lambda
			C -> 0C|1C
	* Problem 4
		* Binary strings starting with 0 and ending with 1
		* qo goes to q1 with a 0
		* q1 self loop siwth 0, 1 and goes to accepting state
		q2 with 1
		* s -> UoX
		  x -> Uo1X|1
		  Uo -> 0
		  Uo1 -> 0|1
		* Not ambiguous, formally with induction on 
		w = 0w1w2...wn
		such that wn = 1 and wi is in {0, 1} for i in the
		natural numbers
	* Problem 5
		* Q = {qo, q1, q2}
		* Sigma = {0, 1}
		* Gamma = {0, 1, $}
		* qo starting state
		* F = {qo}
		* I can't see that big chart thing...sorry guys
* I totally zoned out... he was only talking about homework solutions though
